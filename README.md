# Recommendation_System

The project is to utilize multiple movie data sources to create a movie recommendation system. Four methods are included in this recommendation engine, which are content-based, demographic-based filtering, collaborative filtering and hybrid methods.

Two data sets are from Kaggle:
* The movie dataset:

* TMDb 5000 movie dataset:

Please refer to "Recommendation_Systems" report for data analysis.
